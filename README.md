# My Personal Project
## Project Proposal

The project that I propose to design this term is a whiteboard application. This application will allow the user to
place, edit, move, and delete lines of text that they have written on the whiteboard. I find this project interesting 
because I often wish I had a whiteboard nearby to organize my thoughts while I am working, and with this application I 
could have a **simple** whiteboard *anywhere I have my laptop*. This project is intended for anyone looking to organize
their thoughts on a **simple** whiteboard. This could include students, teachers, anyone giving a presentation,
and more.

## User Stories
Here are the user stories for my project:
- As a user, I want to be able to write some text on a whiteboard
- As a user, I want to be able to have multiple, independent fields of text on a whiteboard
- As a user, I want to be able to move some text that I have written on a whiteboard around
- As a user, I want to be able to edit or delete some text that I have written on a whiteboard
- As a user, I want to be able to resize my whiteboard
- As a user, I want to be able to save the state of my whiteboard (text and positions, size of whiteboard)
- As a user, I want to be able to open a whiteboard I have previously saved
